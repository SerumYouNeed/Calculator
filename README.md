# Calculator
It is a very intuitive application that helps with learning algebra through a quiz mode. You can create your own profile and compete in the leaderboard with other players. Just sit down and start competing for the top spot on the leaderboard. The learning process happens seamlessly — almost in the background of the gameplay. You earn points while reinforcing your quick calculation skills.

## Motivation
Math doesn’t have to be boring or difficult! Unfortunately, this dull version of math is often what our children encounter in schools. My then nine-year-old daughter also experienced this kind of math.  
I started to wonder what I could do to make learning math enjoyable for her. I immediately thought of introducing an element of competition, and that was a total hit! When you start playing the game, there’s no sense of actually learning anything—only the feeling of fun. And it’s in this atmosphere that the magic happens. While the player focuses on earning points, they are unknowingly training their skills in quickly solving mathematical equations.


## Quick Start
Python 3.10.12 or higher is required.  
For Git owners: using your terminal navigate to destination folder and type
```
git clone https://github.com/SerumYouNeed/workout_programming.git
```
If you do not have Git but want to - check out **[Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)** site.  
You can also download zip file. Once unpacked, using your terminal of choice navigate to the folder where the downloaded files are located and type:
```
python3 main.py
```


## Usage
First, you will be asked to create an account or log into an existing one. Then, choose your game mode, and you're all set. Answer the questions and earn points. After the game is over, you can check how your score ranks on the leaderboard.

Project is: _in progress_ 


## Room for Improvement
I believe there are many features to improve.

Room for improvement:
- Graphics are very simple 
- More modes like "root", "squere"...
- Unit converter. Especially arabic to roman numbers :)
- Math explanationts how to solve different equations 

To do:
- CREATE WEB version
